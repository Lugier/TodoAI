# Security Documentation

## Overview

The Computer Automation Agent is designed with security as a core principle. This document outlines the security measures implemented in the system and provides guidance for secure usage.

## API Key Security

### Protecting API Keys

1. **Environment Variables**
   - API keys are stored exclusively in environment variables via the `.env` file
   - The `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits
   - Sample configuration uses `.env.sample` without actual keys

2. **Key Rotation**
   - We recommend rotating API keys regularly
   - If you suspect your keys have been compromised, rotate them immediately

3. **Key Scoping**
   - Use the principle of least privilege
   - For Google Cloud credentials, create dedicated service accounts with minimal permissions

## Data Security

### Data Processing

1. **In-Memory Processing**
   - Task information is processed in memory only
   - Data is not persisted beyond the completion of tasks
   - Screenshots are automatically cleaned up after use

2. **Local Processing**
   - Screen analysis and data extraction happen locally
   - Only API calls to AI services send data externally 

3. **Sensitive Data**
   - The system is designed to avoid capturing sensitive information
   - Users should be careful when using the agent with sensitive information on screen
   - Special care should be taken with financial information, passwords, and personal data

### Data Storage

1. **Temporary Files**
   - Screenshots are stored temporarily during task execution
   - Log files contain execution information but not screen content
   - All temporary data is stored in the `data/` directory
   - Regular cleanup is automated and recommended

2. **Configuration Data**
   - Configuration settings are stored in `src/config.py`
   - No sensitive data should be hardcoded in this file

## Application Security

### Permission Model

1. **OS Access**
   - The agent requires access to screen content, mouse, and keyboard
   - It operates with the same permissions as the user who launched it
   - No elevated privileges are required or requested

2. **Network Access**
   - The agent connects only to configured API endpoints
   - No background or unexpected network connections are made
   - API traffic is encrypted using HTTPS

### Code Security

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Dependencies are specified with version pinning
   - Regular updates for security patches are recommended
   - We use continuous scanning for vulnerable dependencies

2. **Input Validation**
   - All external inputs are validated before use
   - User instructions are processed safely through the AI modeling layer
   - Error handling protects against malformed inputs

## Best Practices for Users

1. **Workspace Considerations**
   - Be mindful of sensitive information visible on screen during operation
   - Close applications with sensitive data before running tasks that don't require them
   - Use the agent in a secure environment

2. **Task Restrictions**
   - The agent should not be used to:
     - Access financial accounts or make transactions without supervision
     - Send sensitive personal information
     - Modify system security settings
     - Interact with encrypted or protected content

3. **Maintenance**
   - Keep the agent and its dependencies updated
   - Regularly review logs for unusual activity
   - Follow security announcements for Python and dependencies

## Security Incident Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by:

1. **NOT** disclosing it publicly on GitHub issues
2. Sending details to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)
3. Providing sufficient information to reproduce and address the issue

## Continuous Improvements

Our security approach is continuously evolving. We regularly:

1. Conduct security reviews of our codebase
2. Update dependencies to address vulnerabilities
3. Improve security documentation and guidelines
4. Respond to security reports from the community
